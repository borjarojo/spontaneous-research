##### Decks/Cards

The idea that I want to explore is a little more general then just a 52 deck of
cards, typical card games like *Magic, The Gathering*, or *Pokemon*. I want to
talk about the nature of the mechanic as a discrete stack, possible randomness,
size, and anything else.

The inspiration for this comes a little bit from games like *Paragon*, that use
card-like objects assembled together to be unlock periodically through a match
creating a customized build out, and *Slay the Spire*, which I have not yet
personally played.

There can be an aspect of card collection, which makes the set dynamic.

Shuffling creates randomness.

Multiples of cards creates different draw percentages. Manipulation of draw
percentages can be a fun mechanic.
